### Best Practices for Secure Remote Access and Cloud Security in the Electricity Sector
Justin Searle, Director of ICS Security, InGuardians
> Remote access has become a requirement for many organizations, including electric utilities. In addition, cloud services have been used more and more for certain applications. This webinar presented best practices for secure remote access (e.g., by equipment suppliers for monitoring and maintenance) as well as the considerations needed to implement cloud services. This webinar delved into how utilities are using remote access and cloud services, what are the risks, what is the software lifecycle (e.g., challenges of onboarding and offboarding cloud-based services), how to do it securely now and in the future, and how to deal with changes on the supplier side.

### Defensible Architecture and Asset Management for Electric Utility Cybersecurity
Markus Mueller, Principal Industrial Consultant, Dragos  
Jason Shea, Senior Cybersecurity Manager, Southern California Edison
> Shifting to a defensible architecture model allows utilities to use an intelligence-based approach to protect their assets from the risks that cyber threats present today. A defensible architecture is not a static design but a process of deploying people, processes, and technology that any utility can follow for more effective asset protection. This practice includes asset management efforts to understand what needs to be protected and what capabilities exist within the environment. The webinar covered best practices for utilities when developing defensible architecture and conducting asset management, addressed the difference between planning for security during new deployment versus reviewing and improving existing ICT networks, network and access control, network configuration, onboarding, and offboarding third-party suppliers for on-premises software/hardware.
