### Leveraging Procurement for Cybersecurity Resilience 
Frank Harrill, Vice President of Security, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL, Inc.)  
Jacob Phillips, Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO)  
> This webinar focused on how procurement in the energy sector can be leveraged to strengthen cybersecurity across transmission system operators (TSOs), distribution system operators (DSOs), and generation entities. Topics explored included how systems associated with managing energy infrastructure, like SCADA and other industrial controls systems, energy market applications, advanced metering infrastructure and billing systems can be made more resilient by embedding cybersecurity specifications in procurement. Speakers considered how existing standards can be implemented to guide procurements through the lifecycle of operations.

### Coordinating Cybersecurity Risk Management with Hardware/Software Vendors
Claudia Iannazzo, CEO and Founder, Catalisto  
Sokol Mukaj, Chief Information Officer, KESH (Albania Power Corporation)
>This webinar focused on the remaining lifecycle of the operation of critical IT and OT systems in a utility. Whereas the previous webinar (Leveraging Procurement for Cybersecurity Resilience) focused on preparing for procurement and conducting procurement/reviewing proposals, this webinar discussed the process of negotiating contracts and maintaining the relationship with the vendor throughout the lifecycle of operations (e.g., receiving and applying patches), and offboarding vendors as needed.
