# Governance, Policies, and Planning

### Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan Development
Michael Martin, Control Systems Engineer, Chelan County PUD  
Tony Assan, Head of IT, GRIDCo (Ghana)
> An incident response plan (IRP) is an essential tool for utilities to prepare for an event and can help drive the utilityâ€™s overall cybersecurity activities. This webinar discussed how utilities should incorporate supply chain cybersecurity considerations into an IRP. Important steps include identifying scenarios, identifying critical utility systems/assets, identifying supporting systems/assets, calculating business impacts, using existing risk analysis, and developing and testing playbooks. This webinar also discussed key strategies to testing and improving the incident response plan and highlighted several useful resources to developing the IRP.

### Governance Policies and Procedures for Third-Party Cybersecurity Risk Management

> This webinar focused on developing and maintaining organizational cybersecurity governance and the best practices on policies and procedures to address supply chain risk management. The webinar highlighted typical models for managing cybersecurity (e.g., the role of a Chief Information Security Officer [CISO] or Chief Security Officer [CSO]) and level of visibility into cybersecurity risks from the senior management to technical staff. The presenters also discussed strategies and approaches to communicating not only within an organization about cyber risks, but also with regulatory authorities, especially in support of review and approval of capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenses expenditures (OPEX) cyber investments.

### Managing Cybersecurity Risks in a Rapidly Expanding Electric Grid

> As utilities rapidly expand electric grids and prepare for transitions from centralized to distributed grids and create new interconnections, consideration of cybersecurity requirements is paramount. Transmission system operators, distribution system operators, and market operators must incorporate distributed energy resources into the electric grid and accommodate independent power producers, generally, but this creates new communication and control requirements which must be secure. This webinar addressed considerations for security of integrations between transmission, distribution, and market operations systems through Cyber Informed Engineering (CIE) and applying the Distributed Energy Resources Cybersecurity Frameworks (DERCF).
